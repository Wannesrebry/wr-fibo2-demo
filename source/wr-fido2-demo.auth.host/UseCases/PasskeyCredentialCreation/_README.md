# Passkey Credential Creation Use Case

This use case handles the registration of new FIDO2 credentials (passkeys) for users. The process follows the WebAuthn specification for registering new credentials.

## Flow Overview

1. **Initiate Registration**
    - The client requests credential creation options
    - The server generates options including:
        - Challenge
        - User information
        - Relying Party information
        - Authenticator selection criteria

2. **Create Credential**
    - The client receives the options and prompts the user to create a passkey
    - The authenticator generates a new key pair
    - The authenticator produces an attestation statement

3. **Verify and Store**
    - The server verifies the attestation response
    - Checks if the credential ID is unique
    - Stores the credential information including:
        - Credential ID
        - Public Key
        - Sign Count
        - User Handle
        - Additional metadata (backup status, AAGUID, etc.)

## Security Considerations

- Credential IDs must be unique per user
- The attestation response is verified for authenticity
- All credentials are stored securely with their associated user data
- Backup eligibility and status are tracked for credential management

## Important Parameters

- **AttestationResponse**: Contains the raw response from the authenticator
- **CredentialCreateOptions**: Server-generated options that guide the credential creation
- **User Data**: Includes user handle and other identifying information
- **Relying Party Info**: Server domain and name information

The implementation ensures secure credential creation and storage while following FIDO2 WebAuthn specifications.
